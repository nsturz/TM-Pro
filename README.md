# TM Pro

A full stack web application for professional artists and tour managers who want to keep track of touring artist data.

## Why I Built This

I spent nearly 10 years travelling around the country as a touring musician throughout my 20's. While on the road, there were many moving parts, and it could become difficult to stay organized. TM Pro is something that I wish I could have used during my time on the road, and this idea was central to my decision making process when building this application.

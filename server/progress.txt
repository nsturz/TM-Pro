- styled the <TourDates /> page to look good on mobile, had some bootstrap kinks
i needed to work out.
- built the <NewTourDate /> component, and styled the form to look pretty much how i
want it to look. this took a good while.
- outside of coding, I was busier than i thought i would be today. got a haircut,
got lunch with sahara, and had to take her to /from the car dealership. also went
grocery shopping.


- tomorrow:
  - would like to add the "schedules" portion of the form, and make it do the
  "plus sign" thing that i thought of.
  - finish issue 3, and hopefully be able to successfully add new tour dates to
  the database. this will complete a big chunk of my project

  - all day, pretty much worked on styling the "schedule" portion of the form. it was kind
  of a pain.
  - began working on the "plus sign" functionality, but am hitting some walls.
  right now, if i click the plus sign, all of the avaliable options show. need to step
  away and think about this for a bit.
